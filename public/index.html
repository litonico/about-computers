	<p><em>First: my wholehearted thank you to <a href="https://moonbase.lgbt/">Luna</a>. I could not have written this without her help. Go follow her blog for good writing about computers.</em></p>
<p>It turns out you can learn a lot from computers just by looking at them.</p>
<p>This involves a clever and litigious company, trademark law, a microscope, nitric acid, and one very dedicated materials science student.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing about gameboys:</p>

	<p>It&rsquo;s May and it&rsquo;s just spring here, which is the right time to write to you about a particular folk song. It&rsquo;s a May Day song, really, the Old May Day, a song for long days and the beginning of summer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a song about getting up before everyone else and feeling full of yourself over it. It&rsquo;s a song about a warm morning.</p>
<p>It also shares a verse with As You Like It, which is real weird. It&rsquo;s weird enough to talk about.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing about telegraphs:</p>
<p>Sometimes, telegraph operators had bad days.
This was usually for mundane reasons. A telegraph pole down. Electrical failures: too much current, burnt wire insulation, or maybe over-curious sheep near the ground return.</p>
<p>On September 2nd, 1859, many telegraph operators had a worse-than-usual day.</p>
<p>It looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/telegraphs_img_1.jpg" alt="An image of a drawing of bright sunspots"></p>
<p>That is how the astronomer Richard Carrington drew a truly immense solar storm. It was the kind of thing that would kill all of the electric grids, everywhere, should it hit today.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Here’s the thing about computers:</p>
<p>There are
<strong>60</strong>
things that you can do with arrays.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<p><img src="/array_img_1.png" alt="60 dyalog APL symbols"></p>
<p>These are ALL of the things that you can do with arrays.</p>
<p>This is the language APL. That stands for “A Programming Language.” The complete ungoogleability of that name wasn&rsquo;t a problem at the time; it was proposed forty-odd years before google. These are not the letters of the language: these are its words.</p>&hellip;
